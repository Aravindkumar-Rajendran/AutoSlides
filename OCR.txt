Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.

The apoplastic movement of water occurs exclusively   through the intercellular spaces and the walls ofthe cells. Apoplastic movement does not involve crossing the cell membrane This movement is dependent on the gradient.

Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in  mesophyll cells: As a result; more water is   drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull: This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.

As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull: This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.

As you know; anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter: Atoms are the building blocks of matter: Since matter has mass, it must be due t0 its atoms. According to the modern atomic theory an atom contains subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons and electrons Protons   and neutrons have considerable mass, but electrons don't have such a considerable mass. Thus, the mass ofan atom is mainly contributed by its protons and neutrons and hence the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number:
2 text
Atomic mass unit is one-twelfth of the mass ofa carbon-12 atom; an isotope of carbon, which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
3 text
As an atom is very small, its absolute mass cannot be determined directly The early pioneers of chemistry used to measure the atomic mass of an atom relative t0 an atom of another element: They measured the masses of equal number of atoms of two or more elements at a time, to determine their relative masses_ They established one element as standard, gave it an arbitrary value of atomic mass and  using   this value they measured the relative mass of other   elements. The mass obtained by this way is called relative atomic mass. In the beginning, the mass of hydrogen atom was chosen as a standard and masses of other atoms were compared with it, because of the existence of isotopic character of hydrogen (HL, H? H)_ Later hydrogen atom was replaced by oxygen atom as the standard. Now, the stable isotope of carbon (C-12) with atomic mass 12 is used as the standard for measuring the relative atomic mass of an element:
4 text
The modern atomic theory is the basis for all the studies of chemical and physical processes that involve atoms You have studied the most fundamental ideas about an atom in your lower classes. Let us discuss some more concepts about atoms in this lesson:
5 text
Modern methods of determination of atomic mass by Mass Spectrometry uses C-12 as standard. For most of the elements; the relative  atomic mass is very closer to whole number and it is rounded off to a whole number; to make calculations easier Table 7.1 lists some of the elements of periodic table and their Ar values.
6 text
Individual atoms are very small and it is difficult to measure their masses. You can measure the mass of macroscopic materials in gram or kilogram: The mass of an atom is measured in atomic mass unit (amu).
7 text
(Note: The symbol amu' is no longer used in the modern system and instead, it uses the symbol U' to denote unified atomic mass. The mass   of proton or neutron is approximately 1 amu).

Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells As a result; more water is  drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull_ more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.

A system can be brought to equilibrium y applying another force, which is equal to the resultant force in magnitude, but opposite in lirection. Such force is called as 'Equilibrant.
10 text
If the  resultant force   of all the   forces acting on a body is equal to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium. Such forces are called balanced forces. If the resultant force is not equal to zero, then it causes the motion of the body due to unbalanced forces Examples: Drawing water   from well,   force applied with a crow bar; forces on a weight balance etc.

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.
1 text
Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells As a result; more water is  drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull_ more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.

Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells As a result; more water is  drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull_ more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.

soil as charged particles (ions) that cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root: Therefore, most minerals enter the rootby active absorption through the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP Then it is transported to all parts by transpiration Pull.

Transpiration is affected by several external factors such as temperature, light,  humidity and wind speed. Internal factors   that   affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, percentage of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc.

Minerals are remobilised from older dying leaves to younger leaves. This phenomenon can be seen in deciduous plants. Elements like phosphorus,  sulphur;  nitrogen  and potassium are easily mobilised, while elements like calcium are not remobilised Small amounts of material exchange takes place between xylem and phloem:

Phloem transports food (sucrose) from ource to a sink The source is part of the plant hat synthesize food, i.e,, the leaf; and sink, is he part that needs or stores the food. But; the ource and sink may be reversed depending on he season, or the plants need.

Since the source-sink relationship is variable; the direction of   movement in the phloem can be   upwards or downwards, ie , bidirectional: In  contrast; the movement is always unidirectional in xylem ies upwards.

Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant  especially through stomata in leaves. Stomata are open in the day and closed at night The opening and closing of the stomata is due to the change in turgidity of the guard cells  When water enters into the guard cells, they become turgid and the stoma open. When the guard cells lose water; it becomes flaccid and the stoma closes.

Water evaporates from mesophyll cells of leaves through the open stomata, this lowers water concentration in mesophyll cells As a result; more water is  drawn into these cells from the xylem present in the veins through the process of osmosis. As water is lost from the leaves, pressure is created at the top to pull_ more water from the xylem to the mesophyll cells, this process is called transpiration pull This extends up to the roots causing the roots to absorb more water from the soil to ensure continuous flow of water from the roots to the leaves.
